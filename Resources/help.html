<h2>
Coloring/Recoloring an Image:
</h2>
<ul>
		<li>To cycle through selecting each object in order of creation press keys 1 (previous) or 2 (next). This could be useful if your object is such that it can’t be selected by clicking on it.
		<li>To translate view, use arrow keys.</li>
		<li>To zoom in/zoom out use +, - keys.</li>
		<li>To create a new image project, click “Load Image” and select an image to recolor.</li>
		<li>Common Error: if the image you select doesn’t color, it was most likely in formatted in “grayscale” mode and must first be converted to “RGB” mode in an external editor.</li>
		<li>To open an existing image project, click open and select the .pmoc file (it must be in the same folder as the .png file with the same name).</li>
		<li>To create a new outlined object, deselect all and switch to vertex mode. Start clicking and dragging points.</li>
		<li>To edit an existing outlined object, first make sure it is selected.</li>
		<li>To select an outlined object, change to “Select Polygon Mode”.</li>
		<li>To select a region of points or objects, use either “Drag Select Objects” or “Drag Select Vertices” mode.</li>
		<li>To select an individual point, change to Vertex Mode, and click on a point on the selected object.</li>
		<li>To move a selected point or selected region use [w, a, s, d] for [up, left, down, right].</li>
		<li>You can also click and drag individual points to move them (only in Vertex Mode).</li>
		<li>To delete the selected point from the selected object, press backspace.</li>
		<li>To delete an object, delete all the points of the object</li>
		<li>To change the color of an outlined object, make sure you have it selected and start manipulating the HSV color sliders.</li>
		<li>To manually invoke a recoloring of an outlined object after manipulating its points or depth, simply reselect the object.</li>
		<li>To manually invoke a recoloring of the entire image after manipulating an object’s points or depth, click “Color By Layers”, (These types of changes aren’t automatically applied. Live color change updates for the entire image proved to be ridiculously inefficient.)</li>
		<li>To specify priority in coloring where objects overlap, you may increase or decrease an object’s depth using the field labeled “Object Depth”.</li>
		<li>For a more natural looking variation in color (skin and hair perhaps), try manipulating the hue and saturation variation sliders.</li>
		<li>For advanced tasks you can involve a secondary color and manipulate the threshold value that divides the two colors using the “secondary” slider.</li>
		<li>Because many borders are shared among objects, I’ve added hover-and-click autocomplete feature for a path of connected vertices of an adjacent object. To change the direction of the auto completed border, use Cmd-R/Ctrl-R or find the option in the Keyboard Shortcuts menu.</li>
</ul>
<h2>
Coloring/Recoloring a video:
</h2>
<ul>
		<li>To load an existing video coloring project, click “Load Video Project” and find and select a .vmoc file.</li>
		<li>To create a new video coloring project, click create video project and find and select a new video file (such as an mp4).</li>
		<li>You will be given the option to move a slider to a starting point in the video and select a number of frames to “grab”.</li>
		<li>This process may take a while as it is creating an image file for each frame of the video.</li>
		<li>When it finishes you may begin working on each individual image (see instructions/help for recoloring an image).</li>
		<li>For each image frame you must manually save your work if don’t want to lose it when you navigate to another frame.</li>
		<li>You can save an individual frame by clicking “Save Frame”.</li>
		<li>You can navigate between frames by using the Video Frame slider.</li>
		<li>By default, navigating to a new video frame that has not yet been saved will retain the object outlines that existed from the previous frame.</li>
		<li>This enables you to work efficiently on consecutive frames that are very similar by only having to make slight modifications each time.</li>
		<li>To make all frames’ colors match a particular frame’s colors, (for example, you’ve already colored several frames and want to change the color of a hat without tediously editing each frame) click the “Apply Frame to All” button. This feature only works, however, if every object in one frame exists in every other frame.</li>
		<li>To render a finished set of frames to video, …</li>
		<li>Some experimental features for video that may be of use are accessible through the buttons “Track Motion” and “Find Edges”. First select the objects or vertices you want to be effected by the action.</li>
</ul>
