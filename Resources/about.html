<h1>About Paul's Coloring Studio</h1>
</center>
<p>
This project was started by me, Paul Soderquist, in January 2018, driven by both a passion for classic cinema and a curiosity for what can be done to improve film colorization techniques. It is entirely written and maintained by me as a nonprofit, open-source project so feel free to offer suggestions or edits but please realize I am limited in the amount of time I can continue to dedicate to this. If you use this software to create something cool, I’d appreciate a shoutout. :)
