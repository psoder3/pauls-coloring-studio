# pauls-coloring-studio
This is a project I began working on in January 2018 (originally titled "Image-Filters") initially propelled by the desire to develop an algorithm that could automatically colorize black and white movies. 

For a detailed description of the journey and its detours, I invite you to read this document:

For a quick look at some of the things I've been able to create, I invite you to view my gallery:

Instructions for running this program:
1. Download the entire repository (you need the libraries and ffmpeg executables in order to use certain features of the application).
2. Extract the zip folder.
3. Run the file named "PaulsColoringStudio.jar".

There are more specific instructions for how to use the application in the Help menu.
