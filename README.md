# pauls-coloring-studio
This is a project I began working on in January 2018 initially propelled by the desire to develop an algorithm that could automatically colorize black and white movies. 

For a detailed description of the journey and its detours, I invite you to read this document:

For a quick look at some of the things I've been able to create, I invite you to view my gallery:

If you wish to use this code, there are several external libraries you'll need to include such as ffmpeg, javacv, opencv, etc. Good luck!
